## Breaking News: It Does Something Now
That's right, folks. We now have a few placeholder textures and a very simple dialogue test scene!
It may not do much, but at least it works!

...Or at least, it does on my computer.

## Compiling (for Linux)
- Make sure you have gcc, make, and allegro installed
- Navigate to the directory that you installed these files to
- And simply run `make`

## On Windows
I've also included a pre-compiled Windows executable. If you're using Windows, the only files you should need are "between_the_trees.exe" (the main program), "dialogue.png" and "name_container.png" (the two placeholder textures for the dialogue box), and the "background" folder.
Make sure they're all downloaded into the same folder.
