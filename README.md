## Compiling
- Make sure you have gcc, make, and allegro installed
- Navigate to the directory that you installed these files to
- And simply run `make`

Keep in mind that no scenes have been added yet, so all the program does is open a window (but you can switch between windowed and fullscreen modes with f11 or alt-enter, if you want).
